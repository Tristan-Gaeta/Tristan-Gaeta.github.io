            <p>
                Hello, my name is Tristan Gaeta. I study mathemetics and computer science at 
                the University of Puget Sound. I am originally from rural Jamestown, NY, where my passion for the 
                outdoors is rooted. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I am interested in our ability to make predictions 
                about complex structures using advanced computing. I believe computers serve as 
                an extension of the human mind and our capacity to understand the inherently 
                mathematical universe around us.
            </p>
