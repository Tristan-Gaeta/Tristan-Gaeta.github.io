            Hello, my name is Tristan Gaeta. I study computer science and mathematics at
            the University of Puget Sound. I am originally from rural Jamestown, NY, where I
            developed a passion for the outdoors.
        </p>

            I am interested in our ability to make predictions
            about complex structures using advanced computing. I believe computers serve as
            an extension of the human mind and our capacity to understand the inherently
            mathematical universe around us.
