                        <ul>
                            <li>This code implements a recursive algorithm to evaluate all 
                                of the possible outcomes of a given game board and suggests the
                                best possible move, assuming the opponent is playing optimally. Since 
                                Tic-Tac-Toe has a finite number of outcomes, the program will 
                                always win or tie the game. There are a number other applications 
                                for such artificial intelligence, such as statistical analysis and 
                                modeling.</li>

                            <li>A Java program that can perform a number of matrix operations over the 
                                real numbers. Such operations include matrix polynomials, transpositions, 
                                row reduction, computing inverses and determinants.
